# ASP.NET Web API for MongoDB v1.x

This document contains the technical details of the solution that will show you how to build a web API using ASP.Net Core (.Net8) that can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on a MongoDB NoSQL database. To ensure security, we will protect the API using JWT (JSON web tokens) authentication. In addition, we will demonstrate how to store user credentials in a MongoDB database by using Asp.NetCore Authentication and Identity.

Features:

- CRUD operations on a NoSQL database
- JWT authentication for enhanced security
- User credential storage in MongoDB with Core Identity
- Containerization and deployment with Docker and Kubernetes

This proof-of-concept showcases how to build modern, stateless back-end applications and services on distributed platforms, offering scalability and resiliency.
